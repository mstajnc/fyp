# Inventory Management System u1276060



The Inventory Management System built as a part of the final year project.
The application was built by using Laravel, and uses MySQL and MongoDB databases. 


## Installation

Please note that the application was developed on 64-bit variant of Ubuntu v14.04.3
To run the application, install it via Composer.

In case database migrations would not be working, commenting out lines 31 to 41 in app\Providers\AuthServiceProvider.php and then uncommenting it again should resolve the problem.
